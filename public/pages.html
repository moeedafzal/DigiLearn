              <p>
                Understanding the overall business strategy should form the
                basis of your mobile app design. Misalignment between company
                strategy and the mobile strategy might be suicidal. There are
                several benefits of creating and executing a mobile strategy
                that’s derived from (and supports) the overall company strategy.

                <li>Reduces training needs.</li>
                <li>It leads to customer satisfaction.</li>
                <li>Decreases integration requirement and bugs.</li>

                  Improvement in quality, value, productivity, employee

                In its simplest form, a successful mobile strategy is the
                meeting point of business goals, mobile opportunities, and user
                needs.

                To get started here is a short checklist that will help you
                understand the business strategy. This checklist will show you
                the current standing of your company in terms of its strategy,
                and where it wants to be in next five years.
              </p>
              <p>
                Follow these steps to fully understand your company’s
                objectives, current standing, competitors, and why and how
                mobile strategy will fit in.
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Your business’s mission statement, its competitive advantages,
                  objectives, and where you want to see it in next 5 – 10 years.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Define customer journey on the mobile. What the app will do?
                  Will customers be allowed to buy from the app directly? Will
                  they be able to check the status of their order?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Create competitor profiles. Who are your competitors? What do
                  they do. What are their strengths and weaknesses in terms of
                  mobile strategy and app? Identify what they do differently,
                  and what they offer on mobile.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                Define the strengths, weaknesses, threats, and opportunities
                SWOT of your business. It will show all the areas of success and
                opportunities. It takes time but it’s worth it.
